React Hooks introduced in version 16.8 revolutionized the way developers work with state and lifecycle in functional components. Hooks allow developers to use state, side effects, and other React features in functional components.

## Why Use React Hooks?

- **Simplifies Functional Components:** Hooks eliminate the need for class components.
- **Encapsulates Logic:** Easily reuse logic across components using custom hooks.
- **Improved Readability:** Cleaner code that is easier to understand and maintain.

## Key Hooks

### useState

The `useState` hook allows you to add state to functional components.

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### useEffect

The `useEffect` hook is used to handle side effects like fetching data or subscribing to events.

```javascript
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const DataFetcher = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => setData(data));
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means this effect runs once after the component mounts.

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
```

## Conclusion

React Hooks enable developers to use state and side effects in functional components, making the code simpler, more readable, and easier to maintain.
