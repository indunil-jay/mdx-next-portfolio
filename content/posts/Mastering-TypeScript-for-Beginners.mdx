TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, adds static typing to the language, enabling better tooling and enhanced development productivity. With its integration into modern web applications, TypeScript has quickly become a must-learn language for developers.

## Why TypeScript?

- **Static Typing:** Catch errors at compile time rather than runtime.
- **Improved Tooling:** Features like autocompletion and inline documentation.
- **Better Collaboration:** Typing improves collaboration in teams, making code more predictable and less error-prone.
- **Integration with JavaScript:** TypeScript is fully compatible with JavaScript, allowing gradual adoption.

## Key Features

### Type Annotations

Type annotations allow developers to define the types of variables, function parameters, and return values.

```typescript
let username: string = "Jane";
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

### Interfaces

Interfaces define contracts within your code, allowing for better structuring and enforcing a shape for objects and classes.

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

function printUser(user: User) {
  console.log(`${user.name} is ${user.age} years old.`);
}
```

## Conclusion

TypeScript enhances JavaScript by introducing static typing and powerful features, making it easier to write clean, reliable code.
