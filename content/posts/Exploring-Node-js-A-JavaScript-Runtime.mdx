Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side. It allows developers to use JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development, making it easier to build full-stack applications.

## Why Node.js?

- **Event-driven architecture:** Handles asynchronous events efficiently, allowing it to scale well.
- **Non-blocking I/O:** Enables fast, non-blocking operations for handling high-volume requests.
- **NPM:** Node.js comes with a powerful package manager (NPM), providing access to a vast ecosystem of packages.
- **Cross-platform:** Runs on various platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Key Features

### Non-blocking I/O

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, meaning it can handle multiple requests without waiting for one to complete before moving on to the next.

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

fs.readFile("example.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Error reading file:", err);
    return;
  }
  console.log(data);
});
```

### NPM (Node Package Manager)

NPM is the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries, making it easy to install and manage dependencies.

```bash
npm install express
```

## Conclusion

Node.js provides an efficient runtime for building fast and scalable network applications. With its non-blocking nature and large ecosystem, it is perfect for building real-time apps, APIs, and microservices.
