MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It is ideal for handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. MongoDB allows easy scaling and is often used in modern web applications.

## Why MongoDB?

- **Schema-less:** Flexible data model that doesnâ€™t require predefined schemas.
- **Scalability:** Easily scales horizontally across many machines.
- **High Availability:** Built-in replication to ensure high availability of data.
- **Rich Query Language:** Allows querying data with simple or complex queries.

## Key Concepts

### Collections and Documents

MongoDB stores data in collections, which are groups of documents. Each document is a set of key-value pairs, similar to JSON.

```javascript
db.users.insertOne({
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 30,
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
});
```

### Querying Data

MongoDB provides a rich query language to fetch and filter documents.

```javascript
db.users.find({ age: { $gt: 25 } });
```

## Conclusion

MongoDB provides a powerful, scalable solution for storing and querying unstructured data, making it an ideal choice for modern web applications.
