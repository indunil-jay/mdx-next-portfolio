React Context API provides a way to share values between components without passing props manually at every level. It's useful for managing global state like themes, authentication, or language preferences.

## Why Use React Context API?

- **Avoid Prop Drilling:** No need to pass props through every intermediate component.
- **Simplified State Management:** Useful for global state management without using Redux.
- **Improved Code Organization:** Makes code cleaner and reduces clutter in components.

## Key Features

### Creating a Context

Create a context with `React.createContext` to provide and consume data.

```javascript
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from "react";

const ThemeContext = createContext();

export const useTheme = () => useContext(ThemeContext);

export const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light");
  };

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, toggleTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

### Using Context in Components

You can now use the `useTheme` hook to consume the context and toggle the theme.

```javascript
import { useTheme } from "./ThemeProvider";

const ThemeToggler = () => {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();

  return (
    <button onClick={toggleTheme}>
      Switch to {theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light"} mode
    </button>
  );
};
```

## Conclusion

The Context API simplifies state management and eliminates the need for prop drilling, making it a valuable tool for small to medium-sized applications.
