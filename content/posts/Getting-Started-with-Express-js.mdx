Express.js is a minimalist web framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of creating a server and handling requests and responses.

## Why Use Express.js?

- **Lightweight:** Minimalistic yet powerful framework for building APIs.
- **Routing:** Simplified routing system for handling HTTP requests.
- **Middleware:** Flexible middleware support for tasks like authentication and logging.
- **Templating Engines:** Integration with templating engines for dynamic page rendering.

## Key Features

### Routing

Express makes defining routes easy with support for dynamic routes, query parameters, and more.

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, World!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

### Middleware

Express allows you to add middleware functions to handle HTTP requests before they are passed to route handlers.

```javascript
const logger = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
};

app.use(logger);
```

## Conclusion

Express.js makes it easier to handle routing and requests in Node.js, offering a clean, modular structure that scales well with growing applications.
